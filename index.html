            <img src="images/photo.jpg" alt="Image of myself" width="400">

            <p>My name is Oto Klavins. I am currently a student at Algonquin college, in the graphic design program. I was originally born in Latvia and moved to Canada in 2020. I have also lived in England for four years. I enjoy doing sports and working out, as well as doing everything creative, from drawing to videography to woodworking.</p>

            <p>During high school I wasn't sure of what I wanted to study after graduation. After some research, I decided to go with the graphic design program because of the possibilities it holds for my future. I understood that graphic design exists everywhere and it is a part of everyday life. Meaning that there will always be something to design and imagine.</p>
