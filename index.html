            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>My name is Oto Klavins. I am currently a student at Algonquin college. I was originally born in Latvia and moved to Canada in 2020. I have also lived in england for four years. I enjoy doing everything creative, from drawing to woodworking.</p>

            <p>I chose the graphic design program because of the possibilities it holds for the future</p>
